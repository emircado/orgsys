# Organization Recognition System (ORgSys)

This project was created as a requirement for the CS 191 and 192 (Software Engineering) courses of the Department of Computer Science of the University of the Philippines, Diliman.

The challenge that this web app attempted to solve was to automate the currently manual and paper-driven renewal process of student organizations in the College of Engineering. On the side of being an academic requirement, there is emphasis on documentation with UMLs and being able to show a proof of concept by doing a vertical prototype of the system.
